##basic key logger using python
 - this program is inspired by https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#monitoring-the-keyboard while making https://github.com/dealthy/DT-Project-Terminal-Typing-Program

 - this program is used in a terminal to log down all the keys that I have pressed. 

 - created by Harry "dealthy" Yu

 - this program requires pynput and python, to install pip3 and python3 is needed

 - future development: possibly develop an admin side program which can duplicate what the client side is doing.
